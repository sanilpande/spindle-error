Bachelor's Thesis - Code

The _spindle-error.py_ file contains the code used to detect the workpiece in a lathe and subsequently measure the spindle radial error. The output of this code is a CSV file of the spindle position with respect to time, which is then curve fitted in MATLAB to obtain the errors in the spindle.

The _CPIE_paper_10_ file contains the paper presented at the 6th International Conference on Industrial and Production Engineering - 2019 at NIT Jalandhar, India. This paper demonstrates the results of tracking a laser spot which is projected onto a perpendicular surface from the spindle, and the error measurement obtained using this methodology.
